## Chapter 1 - Elegance

----

I grew up in the California Bay Area, and my father worked in Silicon Valley. Just to the south of Silicon Valley, there is a famous mansion, the Winchester Mystery House. 

The Winchester Mystery House is an architectural marvel! It is a gorgeous house, which is immactulately maintained. At first glance, from the outside, it appears to be a fairly normal, if colorful, mansion. Yet, a few peculiarities immediately jump out to a more discerning eye. Each window has a different shape and style and no two curtains are quite the same. When you tour the mansion, you quickly discover that the inside architecture is even more wild and peculiar than the outside.

There are staircases leading to nowhere. There are doors build into walls, which are suspended above the floor. There are banisters at unusual places. Archways lean against the vaulted roof in the attic. Artwork is intentionally hung at very odd angles along some walls. Sometimes there is a window placed on the inside of a wall, with no view to the outside. There are wild, winding corridors, which make traversing it's floors quite the adventure.

The strangest thing about the Winchester Mystery House is that all of this design is intentionally, and structurally sound. The design of the house primarily originated in the mind of its designer, Sarah Winchester. The house is well taken care of, and people visit from all over just to see it. Yet, it's a very whimsical house. Most of its features are not designed for practical function. Much of it is different simply because of the superstitious desire to confuse ghosts and to alleviates curses.

In today's software landscape, there are a great many systems which share many properties with the Winchester Mystery House. They are incrementally developed, shaped very oddly, hard to navigate, difficult to understand, yet their designers have all-too-clear stories on precisely how their systems ended up in the shapes their present shapes. These systems are costly, hard to maintain, and impossible to reuse. They are, in a word, inelegant.
