This is a book on Elegant Architecture. 

Many of the principle here apply to all systems. Most of the examples and emphasis will be on how to use these System Principles in order to design elegant software systems.

## Big Idea

"Elegant architecture is the shape of a system which is optimally designed to meet its present and ongoing functional and non-functional requirements."

In practice, an elegantly architected system is one which consists primarily of small, general purpose components, loosely coupled together with a clearly documented arrangement and simple, minimal configuration. 

- Composed Horizontal Components
- Encapsulated Functionality
- Division of Responsibility
