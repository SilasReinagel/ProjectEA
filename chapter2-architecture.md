# Chapter 2 - Architecture

----

Architecture is the arrangement of components in a system.

Every software system has an architecture. The question is whether the architecture of that system is good, bad, or somewhere in between. For functionality-oriented systems, an ideal architecture enables the system to optimally serve its functions. 

Systems of every size have an architecture. Large systems consist of many more components and have a more complex arrangement and configuration of these components. Small systems consist of fewer components, and are simpler to arrange and configure. 

The principles of good architecture apply equally to systems of all types and sizes. What differs is *how* the principles are implemented, and *which* principles are most important for various systems.
