# Chapter 0 - Introduction

There are many books written on various software topics. A vast majority of them are written on how to use a particular software library, tool, or framework. A much smaller subset is about general software design principles and techniques. An even smaller subset is about systems design. 

Building and evolving a single piece of software effectively and elegantly is a great challenge. There are some incredible insights offered by software masters such as Robert C. Martin, Martin Fowler, Yegor Bugayenko, Michael Feathers, Dave Thomas, Sandi Metz, and many others. Our field will forever be indebtted to them for their incredible contributions. 

As the software field has matured, the software development trend has moved more and more towards polyglot systems that consist of numerous applications and software components deployed and configured in a variety of different deployment environments. This is perhaps the most notable in the transition from Monolithic Systems to a Service-Oriented Architecture, and then from Service-Oriented Architecture, to a Microservices Architecture. Now we are beginning to see movements from a Mircoservices Architecture to a Serverless Functions architecture. 

This trend has emerged for architectural reasons. Complex systems are more usable, understandable, and maintainable when they consist of tightly-defined subcomponents. However, there is presently a dearth of literature on software System Design. 

The big software challenge today is not primarily about coding. Instead, the challenges that we face today in the software world are systemic. How can we arrange our systems elegantly, so that the whole system can continue to deliver value and stay flexible? What arrangements will hinder future attempts to evolve our systems?

This book is my attempt to set forth some principles that will help us to design elegant systems of any size. These principles apply equally to large and small systems. They apply equally to systems that are composed of technology, as well as systems in which humans play a large role.
